Welcome to the twelfth issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup’s
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

## Game Updates

### pGLOWrpg

![Improved river pathfinding, paths respect topography](pglowrpg_12.gif)

The [@pGLOWrpg] (Procedurally Generated Living Open World RPG) is a long-term 
project in development by [@Roal_Yr], which aims to be a text-based game with
maximum portability and accessibility and focus on interactions and emergent 
narrative.

For the past month(s) the main focus of the development was on the river
generation system in the worldgen. Main features of the river generator are:

- High robustness with most edge cases covered;
- Single-pass with subsequent iterations generation, with numerous options to 
  tweak the process for either precision of the pattern or speed of generation;
- Rivers are sorted upon intersections, their widths are adjusted, waterfalls
  are formed when necessary;
- Inflow and outflow directions are recorded for each cell, which allows to
  follow the river upstream or downstream;
- Simple yet effective erosion model implemented, which ensures no upwards flows
  are allowed;
- Each stream has its unique ID, which will later be linked to the stream data;
- Streams have 12 orders of magnitude from smallest brooks to major rivers;
- All the options are available to user under "General", "Advanced" and 
  "Very advanced" sections for any level of fine-tuning;

Further development will involve re-factoring of the code and making it ready
to be published prior to implementing new features. For small dev reports follow
[@pGLOWrpg] on Twitter.
